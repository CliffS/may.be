	<h2>About me</h2>
	<div>
	  <p>
	  I trained as an accountant before starting my own business
	  as a software house.  In 1992 I founded Demon Internet, the
	  first dial-up Internet provider in Europe.  As MD, I built
	  Demon as a start-up and sold it 7 years later for £66m.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Using
	  some of the proceeds, I built Redbus Interhouse and, as Executive
	  Chairman, took this company to a flotation the London Stock Exchange.
	  In subsequent years, I have acted as NED or Advisor to a number
	  of Internet and high-tech companies.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I am currently looking for an interim role as CEO or CTO.  I
	  would also be interested in further non-executive directorships.
