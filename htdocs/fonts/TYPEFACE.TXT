Many PC applications have separate menus for selecting
typeface families and typeface styles. Most applications
let you choose among regular, bold, and italic styles in
the Style menu. However, some font packages include font
software with additional style variations and stroke weight
variations. To select these variations, you need to know
how the bold and italic styles are linked to the base
typeface.

For example, the CharterITC BT typefaces include roman,
italic, black, black italic, bold and bold italic. To use
CharterITC BT Black, choose CharterITC BT from the application's
Font Menu(or equivalent), and then choose Bold (or Black)
from the Style menu(or equivalent). To use the bold version,
choose CharterITC Bd BT

If you are using a Microsoft Windows application, follow
the guide to typeface style selection below. For some fonts,
an alternate style may be listed in the guide below. Use the
style that appears in your application. If you are not using a
Microsoft Windows application, use the information below as a
guideline and refer to the application's documentation.
